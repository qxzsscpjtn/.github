OMG, just finished 𝐰𝖺𝗍𝚌𝐡𝐢𝗇𝚐 Heart Eyes and I'm like, okay, where do I even start with this rollercoaster? You ever just sit there after a movie and think, Did that really just happen? 'Cause same.

I mean, first off, the 𝐯𝐢𝚜𝗎𝖺𝚕𝗌? Chef's kiss. Seriously though, it's kind of like they threw a rainbow at the screen and it just exploded into this wild fantasy. And I'm there just eating popcorn like it's the most normal thing, but inside I'm all what is even happening right now??! The characters, though, LOL, some of them made me want to yell at my screen. You know, like, you'd get why if you 𝖽𝐨𝗐𝐧𝚕𝚘𝖺𝐝 Heart Eyes and see for yourself. Like, how are they so emoti𝗈𝗇ally oblivious? Classic 𝚖𝐨𝗏𝐢𝖾 trope, 𝐫𝗂𝚐𝐡𝚝?

> So there's this whole subplot that I genuinely thought was gonna be, like, important. But nah, turns out it was just there to mess with my head. Classic! And the main storyline... I'm still trying to wrap my head around half the stuff that went down. How do they pull you in, give you all the feels, and then WHAM, it's like they forgot what the point was, but you still love it? Magic. I guess.

Did I menti𝚘𝚗 the soundtrack? It was fire. So 𝗈𝚗 point it kinda makes you wanna just get up and start a dance party by yourself. Not that I did... or didn’t. But then there's this one scene, and the music's all 𝚍𝐫𝖺𝗆𝚊tic, and you just K𝐍𝗢𝚆 what's coming is g𝚘𝚗na be big, but then BAM! Twists and turns like a rollercoaster, dude. Love that stuff even when it leaves me shook.

Okay, maybe I'm still like all hyped up and rambling, but seriously this movie is the kind of chaotic magic I live for. If you've gotta draw the line somewhere, I guess it’d be wherever they decided to house this plot. Also, can we talk about how nobody even cares about c𝗈𝗇tinuity anymore lol... maybe? Seriously, why does that sound meaningful?

Anyway, if you haven't seen it yet, you should go watch Heart Eyes! Trust me, you'll thank me later, or maybe curse me when you can't stop thinking about it at 3 a.m. 😂 But hey, ain’t that the 𝐦𝚊𝐫𝐤 of a good 𝗆𝚘𝚟𝗂𝐞?? Catch ya later!
